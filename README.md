## About RSS

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary. It's one of the simplest and standardized ways to remain updated with your favorite blogs, articles, newscasts, social media sites, and other websites of your interest. 
It's one of the ways to let your readers know that new content is published, with a direct link to that article or blog. So readers don't have to manually visit the website and look for the newly published content. 

Contentstack makes it possible to implement RSS on your websites that are powered through Contentstack.
